# Personal Neovim Configuration

My personal Neovim setup based on NvChad, customized for my development workflow.

## üëã About

Hi! I'm Hendrik Hamerlinck ([@hammerlink](https://github.com/hammerlink)), and this is my personal Neovim configuration. It's built on top of NvChad with additional customizations and plugins to support my development needs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- Built on [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) as the base configuration
- Enhanced development workflow with:
  - [overseer.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/overseer.nvim) for task management
  - [neotest](https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest) with [avante](https://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim) for testing
- Optimized for multiple languages:
  - TypeScript
  - Deno (with LSP support and automatic detection)
  - Rust
  - C/C++

## ‚ö° Setup

This repository uses NvChad as a plugin. To use this configuration:

1. Clone this repository to your Neovim config directory
2. The main NvChad modules are imported via `require "nvchad.options"`, `require "nvchad.mappings"`, etc.

## üîß Language Server Configuration

### Deno and TypeScript

- When a `deno.json` file is detected in your project, the Deno LSP is automatically preferred over the TypeScript LSP
- This ensures proper handling of Deno-specific features and import resolution
- No manual configuration is needed - the setup automatically detects and switches based on project type

My personal preference tends towards Deno as they seem to have a very good long-term vision for the language ecosystem.
